## A React App using Google Maps W/O ANY npm packages (A super vanilla way)

#### Functionality:

1. Select Source and Destination (Preferably use google location search APIs).
2. Use Google Direction API
(https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/) to find the directions
from the selected source to destination. 
3. List the waypoints. Use icons, driving instructions, custom stylings etc. to make it intuitive. (Optional: draw it on the map)
